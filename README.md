# AT-code

GSM functions in C++. This code is used in a freescale microcontroller (MC9S08JM60) for the cominication of a GSM Module (Shield GSM/GPRS M95).

Theres only a file (AY_commands.c) where is located the AT commands for the cofiguration of the GSM module to send and receive sms messages. The microcontroller send a sms message throungh the gsm module and can receive a sms message from a cellphone. 
A Cellphone can comunicate to the microcontroller and the microcontroller can send sms messages to the cellphone. A useful protocole for remote control with cellphone where there's not internet connection. Applications in control, sensor monitoring and other remote applications (Domotic, inmotic).
